# Mobile.de Bot
A terminal based python bot for scraping and tracking mobile.de. Get all data for a specific car make and model directly into a spreadsheet, where you can analyze it. Run the checker to see whether the price has changed since the first search.

## Some technical aspects
Built in python 3.8. Essential packages used:
 * selenium
 * bs4
 * threading
 * csv

Not all come standart with python, so if you are using the 1st installation method make sure to have them installed. Or just don't bother and follow installation method number 2.

## Installation
#### First method
1. clone all github files into a folder
2. inside that, create more folders to follow the structure:

3. Run the program from main.py

#### Second method
1. Get the installer here https://www.dropbox.com/s/x3qm4zkv3mb1pd1/Mobile.de%20Bot%20v.Alpha.0.7.5.exe?dl=0
2. Install the app and run "Mobile.de Bot.exe" 

## Running the program (and it's features)
In the terminal you will be presented with this little menu

#### Searching
Start by pressing F1 and introducing a new search. The bot will start execution after all input field have been completed or skipped.
Now that your search has been indexed and executed, find the output file in the "csv files" directory.

Alpha 0.8 update: Now every ad is being assigned a "how good of a deal is this" score. Most accurate with cars of the same or Â± 1 registration year. In Excel (presumably) sort all cells by the score tab from highest to lowest, and find the best deals at the top. I have tested this feature mostly with Lexus vehicles with registration years from 2016 to 2020 and it works like a charm.

#### Check
To see if there are any changes to indexed searches, press F2. Once the checker has been executed, the changes can be found in the .csv files themselves, or will be presented in the terminal window as following

If any of the indexed ads have disappeared from the site you will see a "X ads removed" line at the end of the changes list.

#### Remove
Recommended to be used instead of just deleting the corresponding .csv file.
Press F3 to run and insert the number corresponding to the file you'd like to remove. This will also diable checking this file for price updates.

#### Backup
Pretty self explanatory, backs up all .csv files to a directory with your current timestamp in the backup folder. The checking function does it by default in case something goes wrong, but you still may want to use it from stability concerns.
